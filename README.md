## Configuration

In order to execute this project, you need to place an .env file with the following:

```bash
GREMLIN_SERVER_URL=ws://localhost:8182/gremlin
PINECONE_API_KEY=<PINECONE API KEY>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPEN AI API KEY>
...
# 
```

## Project Purpose

This is a sample project designed as a proof of concept for a potential full-scale implementation. This project has as intention to provide knowledge on how to implement a simple RAG Sytem using various techniques. In order to build a Vector Database, we have implemented FAISS (locally) or Pinecone Free tier service.

Its main goal is to evaluate the skills in:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Information Retrieval (IR)
- Generative AI
- and/or Semantic Search
- Generate answers from stored values.

### This analysis aims to extract meaningful insights from the text file documents in order to help answer questions with information within the text documents library
